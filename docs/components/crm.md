# Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Client relationship Management system is a versatile data-based product which Murray PHN has configured to meet many of the PHNs' business needs. Other PHNs are now adopting this ‘PHN in a box’.

PHN in a Box is a PHN customisation of the Dynamics 365 customer relationship management system. There are many functions and workflows built within PHN in a Box. For the purposes of this guide though we will focus on the GP profile.

The GP profile is a minimum data set about each of the practices your PHN supports. Whilst it is not possible to gather all of the information required, the profile is intended to be updated regularly over time. If you believe additional fields are required, please talk with your manager who can inform the development team.

Future development of systems may integrate the two systems.
