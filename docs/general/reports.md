# Reports
The reports sections contain consolidated global reports for your PHN. The screen shot below shows the PHN dashboard and a list of practices which are compliant or non-compliant for the quarter.

It is the individual Business partner (staff member) for each practice who is responsible for following up with non-compliant practice to identify the issues and to ensure data is shared by the practice in the quarter.

## PIP QI Report
The dashboard draws information from the GP profile within PHN Exchange. This information is updated and kept current by the practice as they login to their GP data report.
This information is used in the PHNs report to the Department to enable PIP QI payment to the Practice. It is crucial that this information is correct. You may need to work with your practice to ensure their profile information is accurate.
