# PIP QI {#pipqi}
On 1 August 2019, the Department launched the Practice Incentive Payment Quality Improvement Medical Benefits Scheme Incentive (MBS) payment for General practices who actively share a defined data set with their PHN and participate in data quality improvement activities
Generally, most data extraction software available on the market today extracts more data sets than are required for a practice to receive the Medicare payment. PHNs usually wish to enter into data sharing arrangements with practices to extract as much data as possible. However, some practices prefer to only share the PIP QI data set. 
The PHN Exchange and its GP data report automates the recording and much of the reporting required by the Department.
