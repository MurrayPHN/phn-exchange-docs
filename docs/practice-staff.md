# PHN Admin

## Practice cannot see "General Practice" button on PHN Exchange after login

PHN Exchange gives members permission to view practice details if they are a Practice Member

Practice Members are either added Automatically or Manually.

### Automatic Process

If the email address in PATCAT against a practice is the same email address that they have registered with, they are automatically assigned as a practice admin.

To confirm if a practice has the correct email address assigned in PATCAT:

- Login to your PHN PATCAT portal, for Murray PHN it isÂ https://patcat.murrayphn.org.au/
- In the top right of the page after login click "Practices"
- Find the relevant practice and check the email address associated with the practice and make sure it is correct.
- After updating the email address in PATCAT, PHN Exchange should take 1 minute to synchronize the changed PATCAT details
- After PHN Exchange has detected the email change, general practice user using the email address needs to logout and log back in again to now see the "General Practice" section.

## Manual Process

- Login to the PHN Exchange
- Click Admin on the left meny and navigate to your PHN
- Open the Practices section and find the relevant practice
- Scroll the bottom of the practice page and find the Practice Members section
- Click "Create" and a popup will appear, supply an email address of a registered account on the PHN Exchange and toggle the flag "Is Practice Manager" to YES and click the CREATE button.
