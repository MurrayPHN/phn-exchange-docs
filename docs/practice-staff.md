# PHN Admin

## Practice not able to see "General Practice" section of PHN Exchange after login

The PHN Exchange has two methods of approving people seeing the "General Practice" section on the left navigation menu.

The users email address was found to be connected to an account in the PATCAT database
The user was manually added as a Practice Member in the admin portal of the PHN Exchange
When a general practice logs into the PHN Exchange and is not able to automatically see the "General Practice" section on the left navigation menu, this means that the email address that they have registered with was not detected within patcat.

To resolve this issue:

Login to admin of PHN Exchange and check the current email address of the practice and check if it is correct, if it is not correct:
Login to the patcat portal https://patcat.murrayphn.org.au/ (different for each phn)
In the top right of the page after login click "Practices"
Find the relevant practice and check the email address associated with the practice and make sure it is correct.
After updating the email address in PATCAT, PHN Exchange should take 1 minute to synchronize the changed PATCAT details
After PHN Exchange has detected the email change, general practice user using the email address needs to logout and log back in again to now see the "General Practice" section.
